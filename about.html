    <h2>Principal’s Message</h2>
    <h4>Rev. Fr. Dr. Godwin Rufus, S.J.</h4>
    <p>St. Xavier’s College, established at Palayamkottai in 1923 by Jesuit Fathers, is a sylvan historian narrating a sublime tale of human excellence, endurance, and commitment. Founded to empower marginalized youth of southern Tamil Nadu through quality education, the college embraces the motto Veritate Lumen et Vita — Light and Life through Truth.</p>
    <p>Recognized as a First Grade College by Madras University in 1925 and later affiliated with Madurai Kamaraj University and Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, St. Xavier’s was granted autonomy in 1987. It has received numerous accolades including the prestigious “College with Potential for Excellence” status by the UGC and high-grade accreditation by NAAC, most recently “A++” Grade in 2019.</p>
        <p>Today, the college offers 20 undergraduate, 15 postgraduate, and 12 research programmes, enriched by 127 extra credit/add-on courses. With ICT-enabled teaching, a proactive Placement Cell, cultural events like INDECO, and student counselling services, we strive to provide holistic education.</p>
        <p>Our Department of Human Excellence, along with outreach programs such as STAND (Student Training and Action for Neighbourhood Development), fosters academic excellence, social commitment, and humanism. We take pride in our illustrious alumni who have excelled in diverse fields.</p>
        <p>The centenary year (2022–23) marked a historic milestone with celebrations including marathons, exhibitions, tournaments, and conferences, reinforcing our commitment to quality education and social responsibility.</p>
        <p>These achievements are possible due to the cohesiveness of the Jesuit Management, Faculty, Staff, Students, Alumni, and Parents. We envision our students as messengers of hope and knowledge, carrying forward the legacy of St. Xavier’s College with integrity and compassion.</p>
